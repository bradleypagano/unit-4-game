# Crystal Collector Game!

This is a simple number generation game.  We had to assign random values to 4 different images.  Each time the game ends, new numbers are assigned to each of the crystals.  Basically, I used Math Random on a floor of 1 to generate the random numbers that were assigned to the crystals.  The target number was generated much higher than the crystals.  The rest of the game runs on an If statement.  If the player score equals the number in the target box, then the player wins.  If they go over, they lose.  Then the numbers are generated again, and the wins and losses incriment.
